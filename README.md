Notes on the Handbook of Practical Logic and Automated Reasoning
by John Harrison (https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511576430).

The code and tests contained are adapted and/or copied from the original code
accompanying the book. The code has been adapted to work with modern [OCaml
4.14 & 5.x](https://v2.ocaml.org/manual/index.html) and in many places to use the
OCaml standard library instead of a custom prelude. Many of the interactive
examples in the original text are encoded as tests.
